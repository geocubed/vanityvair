      <p>“Neo Babies” , the new popular term for those who are related to celebrities and benefit from their fame, can be a simple metric yes no. But when it comes to Malka Martz, the niece of Larry David things get a little more complicated. When Martz was 7, she refused to go trick-or-treating. Not even the promise of Kit Kats or Mars Bars could persuade her to put on her Halloween costume. It was simply too embarrassing.</p>

      <p>This was the moment when she realized she had inherited her uncle, Larry David, anxiety.</p>

      <p>We have the same low opinion of ourselves,” he says. “We are in a contest as to who is crazier. I can’t smoke weed because of what it does to me physically, but she can. So I said, ‘There’s proof — I’m definitely crazier.’ And then I find out she can’t sing when she’s by herself, because she’s too self-conscious. So now I think she wins.”</p>

      <p>Malka, now 23, is a comedy writer, independent director and producer. Her work could be best described by the words: eclectic, odd and hilariously awkward.</p>

      <p>Actress model and infamous Neo baby. Lily-Rose Depp (daughter of Johnny Depp and French singer Vanessa Paradis), appearing to outright deny her privilege in an interview with Elle. Depp stated:</p>

      <p>“Just because my daddy was in the casting room and took the casting directors out for dinner doesn’t mean I am going to get the part! The internet cares way too much about how celebrities got to where they are. Like just enjoy us and don’t ask questions it’s not like you’ll ever be one”</p>

      <p>Zoe Kravitz, daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet, recently told GQ Magazine that she feels insecure about the fact that her parent’s names helped propel her into stardom. She followed up this admission with a more defensive statement, saying: “It’s completely normal for people to be in the family business. It’s literally where last names came from. You were a blacksmith if your family was, like, the Black family. However in Malka’s case for better or for worse she doesn’t have the infamous ‘David’ name. This is because Malka’s mother decided to keep her maternal name: ‘Martz’. </p>

      <p>Like her uncle, famous for the iconic Seinfeld and HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” Martz is now also trying to tackle her own relationship with humor. Malka was caught this year at the “Canadian Sundance” AKA Whistler Film Festival with a short film entitled “Hats Off” an absurd comedy following a woman in a strange world where no one has emotions. The film treatise on the popularity of film “Poor Things” and North Americans love of watching women be ignored.</p>
